<h1>Project Description:</h1>
The FasTuga Driver Application is a school project designed to enhance the FasTuga restaurant's business by providing an additional value to its customers. The goal of the project is to develop a mobile application that allows drivers to deliver orders to customers while earning money. The application should interact with a centralized support system that holds details about the orders, customers, and drivers.
<br><br>
When the driver opens the application, she will have access to a dashboard that shows the list of available orders and a dedicated area of the orders that are assigned to her. She can select an order based on the criteria of the nearest or farthest location, get directions to the destination, and optimize the total time of delivery. The driver can self-assign herself to a specific order, claim the order when it is ready for pickup, and initiate the delivery process. If the driver has any difficulties with the delivery, she can inform the restaurant through the application.
<br><br>
The driver earns fixed fees based on the length of the route. For routes up to 3 km, the driver earns 2€ per route, for routes up to 10 km, the driver earns 3€ per route, and for routes of greater length, the driver earns 4€ per route. Once the delivery process is finished with success, the driver can see her updated account balance.
<br><br>
The FasTuga Driver application also provides a statistics feature that allows the driver to check the number of deliveries conducted, the average and total time of the deliveries, the total amount earned, the number of distinct customers served, and more.
<br><br>
To use the application, the driver has to register and conduct a valid login. All the features will be available, and at any time, the user can logout or opt-out from the application.
<br><br>
The FasTuga Driver application is designed to be simple and easy to use, providing a seamless experience for drivers and enhancing the FasTuga restaurant's business by providing an additional value to its customers.
